### Hi there, I'm Eren :space_invader:
- I mess around with some code stuff.
- I use Github... 
-- to create simplified implementations of some concepts I've learned and use like [Message Queueing with RabbitMQ in Spring Boot](https://github.com/celikeren/spring-boot-rabbitmq-demo)
-- as a playground to try new languages, frameworks like [Simple Counter App with ReactJS](https://github.com/celikeren/counter-app)
-- to create cheat sheets while I learn like [Docker Cheatsheet](https://github.com/celikeren/docker-cheatsheet)
